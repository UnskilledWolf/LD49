# Ludum Dare 49
## Theme: Unstable
1. lacking stability, fixity, or firmness
2. disposed to temperamental, emotional, or psychological variability
3. (of a chemical compound) readily decomposing 
4. physics
   1. (of an elementary particle) having a very short lifetime
   2. spontaneously decomposing by nuclear decay; radioactivean unstable nuclide
5. electronics (of an electrical circuit, mechanical body, etc) having a tendency to self-oscillation

## Ideas
1. An unstable programm
2. Jenaga / Physics game
   1. > Too generic
3. Something about controlling a reactor and keeping it from being unstable
   1. > Maybe having pushing it to be stable
      1. **Story idea**: P is on a spacvessel that must be stopped, but the computer was somehow overwritten, so that the reactor must be manualy shut down
         1. The player must get the reactor's stability to a certain threshold
      2. > HOW WILL THE GAMEPLAY WORK?
         1. Maybe throw things into it. The computer will try to clean the reaction up
         2. Replicator takes replicatro credits
            1. Get by hacking (slowest, gives some credits)
            2. Maintaining systems (fastest, stabelizes, gives most credits)
               1. Cooldown
            3. +1 every 5 seconds
            4. Winning minigame (Medium)
               1. Rock paper scicors
            5. Clearning file system (Worst)
