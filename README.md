*Someone* updated the computer on the spaceship you are on. However, it seems that the computer has started a route straight into an asteroid. To stop it, you have to destabilize the reactor, so that it will be auto-ejected.

## Gameplay

Gain credits by completing tasks, such as doing maintenance and interacting with the computer to the right. You also passively get some credits.

With the credits, buy things from the constructor to throw anything you can get your hands on into the reactor. However, the reactor will slowly repair itself.

If you can make it unstable within 2 minutes, you win.

**Doing Maintainance on panels will also repair the reactor a bit**
